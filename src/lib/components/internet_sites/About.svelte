      About Myself
    </h2>
    <p class="text-center">
      I am a {new Date().getFullYear() - 2003} year old Software Student at LEGO
      Education, mostly working within a full-stack environment. I spend a lot of
      time on personal programming projects, and I am also very passionate about
      open-source software
      <span class="text-xs"
        >(this is also why I've taken the decision to GPL this project).</span
      >
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-yellow-300 font-black text-xl text-center underline">
      Which technologies do I have experience in?
    </h2>
    <p class="text-center">
      I have work experience in programming languages such as TypeScript,
      JavaScript, and C++, mostly using web technologies such as React. A lot of
      my personal projects are in lower-level languages such as Rust. I also
      have additional experience in C# as part of my schooling.
      <br />
      Apart from work experience, I have experience in Svelte
      <span class="text-xs"> (which has been used for this project)</span>,
      Machine-Learning, Data-Science, Compilers
      <span class="text-xs"> (and lexers & parsers)</span>, UNIX operating
      systems, and more.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-yellow-300 font-black text-xl text-center underline">
      What are you interested in?
    </h2>
    <p class="text-center">
      I am very interested in everything open-source, I try to use as much
      public software as I can, and I use Linux as my personal operating system.
      Apart from technology, I like learning more about academic subjects such
      as History, Culture, and Language. I also read books in my free time <span
        class="text-xs"
      >
        (non-fiction, fantasy, mostly.)
      </span>
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-yellow-300 font-black text-xl text-center underline">
      What are your past projects?
    </h2>
    <p class="text-center">I don't have many public repositories, sorry!</p>
